# Code Explanation
The given code uses Natural Language Toolkit (nltk) to extract specific tokens from a list of captions. It applies part-of-speech tagging to each token and extracts nouns, verbs, and adjectives. The extracted tokens are then combined to form noun phrases, verb phrases, and adjective phrases. Finally, all the extracted phrases are combined to form a single list of tokens.


## Importing Required Libraries
```
import nltk
from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize
from nltk.tag import pos_tag
```
The code imports the required libraries to perform text tokenization and part-of-speech tagging.

## Downloading Required Data
```
nltk.download('punkt')
nltk.download('averaged_perceptron_tagger')
```
The nltk.download() function is used to download required data from the nltk library. Here, we download the 'punkt' and 'averaged_perceptron_tagger' packages, which are required for tokenization and part-of-speech tagging, respectively.

## Tokenization and Part-of-Speech Tagging
```
# Tokenize the caption
tokens = word_tokenize(caption)

# Tag each token with its part of speech
tagged_tokens = pos_tag(tokens)
```
The word_tokenize() function is used to tokenize each caption into individual words. The pos_tag() function then assigns a part-of-speech tag to each token.

## Extracting Specific Tokens
```
# Extract specific tokens based on their part of speech
nouns = [token[0] for token in tagged_tokens if token[1].startswith("N")]
verbs = [token[0] for token in tagged_tokens if token[1].startswith("V")]
adjectives = [token[0] for token in tagged_tokens if token[1].startswith("J")]
```
The code extracts specific tokens based on their part of speech. Here, nouns, verbs, and adjectives are extracted based on the 'N', 'V', and 'J' part-of-speech tags, respectively.

## Forming Noun Phrases
```
# Combine extracted tokens into meaningful phrases
noun_phrases = []
current_phrase = []
for token in tagged_tokens:
    if token[1].startswith("N"):
        current_phrase.append(token[0])
    elif current_phrase:
        # Combine consecutive nouns into noun phrases
        noun_phrases.append(" ".join(current_phrase))
        current_phrase = []
if current_phrase:
    noun_phrases.append(" ".join(current_phrase))
```
The code forms noun phrases by combining consecutive nouns. It first initializes an empty list, noun_phrases, to store the formed phrases. Then, it loops over each token and checks if it is a noun. If it is, the token is added to the current phrase. If not, the current phrase is added to the noun_phrases list, and the current phrase is reset to an empty list.

## Forming Verb and Adjective Phrases
```
verb_phrases = verbs

adjective_phrases = []
current_phrase = []
for token in tagged_tokens:
    if token[1].startswith("J"):
        current_phrase.append(token[0])
    elif current_phrase:
        # Combine consecutive adjectives into adjective phrases
        adjective_phrases.append(" ".join(current_phrase))
        current_phrase = []
if current_phrase:
    adjective_phrases.append(" ".join(current_phrase))
```
The code forms verb phrases by simply storing the extracted verbs in a list, verb_phrases.

For forming adjective phrases, the code follows the same logic as noun phrases. It initializes an empty list, adjective_phrases, and loops over each token, checking if the token's part of speech tag starts with "J", indicating that it is an adjective. If the token is an adjective, it is added to the current_phrase list. If the token is not an adjective but the current_phrase list is not empty, it means that a consecutive sequence of adjectives has ended and the current phrase can be combined into an adjective phrase by joining the tokens with a space and adding it to the adjective_phrases list. The process continues until all tokens have been processed, and any remaining adjectives are added to the list as a single token phrase. The resulting list of adjective phrases is then added to the extracted_tokens list for the current image.

Finally, the script saves the extracted tokens to a new file called 'tags30k.txt'. It opens the file in write mode and iterates over the extracted tokens list. For each element in the list, it writes the corresponding image ID and the extracted tokens separated by space to a new line in the file.

In summary, the script takes a list of image captions, tokenizes and tags each caption, extracts specific tokens based on their part of speech, combines extracted tokens into meaningful phrases, and saves the resulting tokens for each image to a new file. This can be useful for various natural language processing tasks such as text classification, sentiment analysis, and topic modeling.
